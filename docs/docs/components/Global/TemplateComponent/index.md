# TemplateComponent

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Use this template file as the starting point for documenting other components in the library.

The `TemplateComponent` represents a general purpose div element that can be configured with styles and functionality as needed. It is completely style- and functionality-agnostic, allowing for full flexibility of use across a variety of projects and contexts.

## Using the Component

```jsx
// Add sample markup for using the component. For example:
import { TemplateComponent } from "@hessler/lc-component-library-io";

<TemplateComponent className="my-template-component-class">
  Primary Button Example
</TemplateComponent>
```

## Properties

The following properties are available:

- `{object} props` - The component props object.
- `{string} props.someProp` - An example of an explicitly-defined property of the component props object.
