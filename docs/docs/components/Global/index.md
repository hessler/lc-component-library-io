# Global Components

The `global` components contains the available global components for the library.

> 💁🏻‍♂️ **Note:** All components are exported with their directory-specific scope prefixed at the start of the component name _(e.g. `/components/global/ButtonItem` is exported as `GlobalButtonItem`)_.
